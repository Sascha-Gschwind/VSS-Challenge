# VSS-Challenge
## Requirements
1. Use at least one text protocol, at least one binary protocol
2. Load balancing
3. Scalable service with authentication 
* Non-scalable storage (you can build it scalable if you want)
* Self-hosted preferred 
* The solution may use existing libraries and code, but those must be allowed to be published under an open software license

## Goal
1. Simple Frontend (e.g., HTML, Vue, React) 
2. Loadbalancer (e.g., traefik) 
3. Two instances of a service (your choice) (REST / HTTP / ZeroMQ / Protobuf) 
    1. Coin tracker, survey / form, monitor application health, â€¦ 
4. One KV storage backend (Protobuf)
5. Authentication (e.g., basic auth)
